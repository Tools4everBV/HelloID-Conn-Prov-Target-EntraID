## Requirements

1. **HelloID Environment**:
   - Set up your _HelloID_ environment.
   - Install the _HelloID_ Provisioning agent (cloud or on-prem).
1. **Graph API Credentials**:
   - Create an **App Registration** in Microsoft Entra ID.
   - Add API permissions for your app:
     - **Application permissions**:
       - `User.ReadWrite.All`: Read and write all user’s full profiles.
       - `Group.ReadWrite.All`: Read and write all groups in an organization’s directory.
       - `GroupMember.ReadWrite.All`: Read and write all group memberships.
       - `UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All`: Read and write all users’ authentication methods.
       - `User.Invite.All`: Invite guest users to the organization.
       - `User-Phone.ReadWrite.All`: Read and write all user mobile phone and business phones.
   - Create access credentials for your app:
     - Create a **client secret** for your app.

## Remarks

### Account Creation Limitations

- The [Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-post-users?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) has limitations when creating accounts. As a result, accounts may be created without all attributes. Since the correlation value is mandatory, HelloID can correlate the account when retrying the action.

### Supported Group Types

- The [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/groups-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0) exclusively supports Microsoft 365 and Security groups. Mail-enabled security groups and Distribution groups cannot be managed via this API. To manage these types of groups, use the [Exchange Online connector](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-ExchangeOnline).

### Managing Permissions in Teams

- The script for dynamically managing permissions in Teams is similar to that for Groups, with an added filter for Teams-enabled groups. This is because a Team is inherently an M365 group, allowing us to manage its members within the group context rather than within Teams itself.

### Creating Guest Accounts

- Direct creation of Microsoft Entra ID Guest accounts (with login names under the tenant domain) is preferred.
- By specifying the `userType` as 'Guest' in the mapping, Guest accounts with login names under the tenant domain can be created effortlessly.

### Inviting Guest Accounts

- "Invite as Guest" is supported by using a separate targetconnector.
- Use the create-script and the fieldmapping from the `guestInvite` folder. The orginal config and other event scripts can be used from the original connector.
- Manager can be set of an invited guest but is not based on a managerreference. The manager is searched by the corresponding employeeid, cause mostly the managerreference is not available as a `GuestInvited` account.
- User credentials and e-mailaddress are based on an external e-mailaddress of the employee

### Authentication Methods

- Granting and revoking `email` and `phone` authentication methods are supported.
- Chance mapping in the `grantPermissions.ps1` according to the HelloID person model.
- Configure `OnlySetWhenEmpty` and `RemoveWhenRevokingEntitlement` settings in `permissions.ps1` if needed.
  - Revoking authentication methods can give issues when the default method is revoking before others. This is the reason that our best practice is setting this value to `$false`.

### Handling Null Values in Field Mapping

- The script filters out all field mappings with the value `$null`. If the value in the HelloID person model is `$null`, it is also filtered out. If this behavior is not desired, change the mapping to complex and ensure you return a string with a `space` or `empty` when the value is `$null`. This way, the value is correctly handled by the script.

#### Example:

```javascript
function getCompanyName() {
  let companyName = Person.PrimaryContract.Employer.Name;
  if (companyName === null) {
    companyName = " ";
  }
  return companyName;
}
getCompanyName();
```

\*\*

### Limitations Without Exchange Online Connector

This connector is designed exclusively for Entra ID and does not integrate with Exchange Online. As a result, it has the following limitations compared to the built-in Azure AD connector:

#### ProxyAddress Expansion with Aliases

- It cannot expand ProxyAddress with additional aliases, which is crucial for managing multiple email addresses for a single user.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `mail` and `userPrincipalName` fields are different, the `mail` value will automatically become the primary SMTP address, and the `userPrincipalName` will be added as an alias.

#### Modifying showInAddressList

- It cannot modify the showInAddressList attribute, which determines whether a user appears in the global address list (GAL).

#### Mailbox Creation/Activation

- Mailboxes cannot be created or activated until a license is assigned, causing delays in email setup for new users.

## Introduction

_HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-Microsoft-Entra-ID_ is a _target_ connector. _Microsoft_ provides a set of REST API's that allow you to programmatically interact with its data. The Microsoft Entra ID connector uses the API endpoints listed in the table below.

## Getting started

By using this connector you will have the ability to seamlessly create and user accounts and groups in Microsoft Entra ID. Additionally, you can set the MFA phone or email settings.

Connecting to Microsoft the Microsoft Graph API is straightforward. Simply utilize the API Key and API Secret pair.
For further details, refer to the following pages in the Microsoft Docs:

- [Use the Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-the-api).
- [User Properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/user?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties).
- [Supported User Properties for Correlation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/aad-advanced-queries?tabs=http#user-properties).

### Provisioning PowerShell V2 connector

#### Correlation configuration

The correlation configuration is used to specify which properties will be used to match an existing account within _Microsoft Entra ID_ to a person in _HelloID_.

To properly setup the correlation:

1. Open the `Correlation` tab.

2. Specify the following configuration:

    | Setting                   | Value        |
    | ------------------------- | ------------ |
    | Enable correlation        | `True`       |
    | Person correlation field  | `ExternalId` |
    | Account correlation field | `employeeId` |


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The account correlation field is added to the create action. If you use a different value then `employeeId`, please make sure this is support by the [graph api](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-post-users?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)

> [!TIP] > _For more information on correlation, please refer to our correlation [documentation](https://docs.helloid.com/en/provisioning/target-systems/powershell-v2-target-systems/correlation.html) pages_.

#### Field mapping

The field mapping can be imported by using the _fieldMapping.json_ file.

### Connection settings

The following settings are required to connect to the API.

## Connector setup

### Application Registration

The first step to connect to the Graph API and make requests is to register a new **Microsoft Entra ID Application**. This application will be used to connect to the API and manage permissions.

Follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to App Registrations**:

   - Go to the Microsoft Entra ID Portal.
   - Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **App registrations**.
   - Click on **New registration**.

2. **Register the Application**:

   - **Name**: Enter a name for your application (e.g., "HelloID PowerShell").
   - **Supported Account Types**: Choose who can use this application (e.g., "Accounts in this organizational directory only").
   - **Redirect URI**: Choose the platform as `Web` and enter a redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost`).

3. **Complete the Registration**:
   - Click the **Register** button to create your new application.

For more detailed instructions, please see the official Microsoft documentation: [Quickstart: Register an app in the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate).

### Configuring App Permissions

Next, configure the necessary API permissions for your Microsoft Entra ID application. For this connector, we use the **Microsoft Graph API**.

Follow these steps:

1. In your Microsoft Entra ID application, navigate to the **API Permissions** section.
2. Click on **Add a permission**.
3. Select **Microsoft Graph**.
4. Choose **Application permissions** and add the following:
   - `User.ReadWrite.All`: Read and write all user’s full profiles.
   - `Group.ReadWrite.All`: Read and write all groups in an organization’s directory.
   - `GroupMember.ReadWrite.All`: Read and write all group memberships.
   - `UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All`: Read and write all users’ authentication methods.
   - `User.Invite.All`: Invite guest users to the organization.
5. Click **Add permissions**.
6. If required, click on **Grant admin consent for [Your Tenant]** to grant the necessary permissions.

For more detailed instructions, please see the official Microsoft documentation: [Quickstart: Configure a client application to access a web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis).

### Authentication and Authorization

To authenticate to the Graph API using the Authorization Code grant type, you need to obtain the necessary credentials. We recommend using the Client secret.

Follow these steps:

1. **Get the Tenant ID**:

   - In the Microsoft Entra ID Portal, go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Overview**.
   - Copy the **Tenant ID** from the Overview page.

2. **Get the Client ID**:

   - Go to the Microsoft Entra ID Portal.
